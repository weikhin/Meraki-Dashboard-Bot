# Meraki-Bot
Webex Bot to Retrieve Meraki Data

This is a Webex Meraki-Bot.JS bot application that I have built using the Webex-Bot-Starter  https://github.com/WebexSamples/webex-bot-starter


serves as a template to be further extended. It features the webex-node-bot-framework that simplifies development for Webex bots by abstracting away some of the complexity of the API calls and registering for events.
