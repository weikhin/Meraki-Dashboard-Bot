# Meraki-Bot
Webex Bot to Retrieve Meraki Dashboard Data

This is a Webex Meraki-Bot.JS bot application that I have built using the [Webex-Bot-Starter](https://github.com/WebexSamples/webex-bot-starter) as a template. It uses the [Webex-Node-Bot-Framework](https://github.com/WebexCommunity/webex-node-bot-framework) which simplifies developemnt for Webex bots.
